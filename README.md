# NNDL_ASS6

Used the use case in the class
Added more Dense layers to the existing code and checked how the accuracy changes.
Changed the data source to Breast Cancer dataset * available in the source code folder.
Normalized the data before feeding the data to the model and checked how the normalization change your accuracy.
Ploted the loss and accuracy for both training data and validation data using the history object in the sourcecode
Plotted one of the images in the test data, and then do inferencing to checked what is the prediction of the model
We had used 2 hidden layers and Relu activation. Tried to change the number of hidden layer and the
activation to tanh or sigmoid and see what happens
Ran the same code without scaling the images and checked the performance.
